Core Features Product selection with dropdown or search and category
filtering Printing recommendation engine that returns available methods,
color limits, notes, and optional ranking Smart filtering based on color
count, budget, quantity, and material Admin panel to add edit products
and update printing capabilities Production time estimator with static
database time and future dynamic calculation API layer for product list,
recommendation, and admin updates
